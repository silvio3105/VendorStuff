# VENDOR STUFF

This repo is collection of vendor MCU related stuff(eg., drivers from STM for STM32).
I've only collected stuff into one repo so I can use it without configuration tools(eg., STM32CubeMX).
Unnecessary files are removed.


It also includes CMSIS configurator. It's not vendor stuff. I made copy of a copy just in case.
